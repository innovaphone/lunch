# Lunch

This project is a **simple Lunch App** for use with the **myApps** environment.

The app was developed rather quickly so that innovaphone would have a solution for its own cafeteria. As a result, there is very little flexibility, and the app is therefore unlikely to be suitable for many other companies and their cafeterias.

## üîç Purpose

You may use the code to build your own modified Lunch App with small modifications if needed.

## üí° What's Included?

- Example code 

## Getting started

Note that it's not possible to directly compile this project without modifications! You may use it to build your own App though.

To compile an own binary out of this code, you would need to:

- install the innovaphone SDK
- create a new innovaphone C++ application
- copy & paste the code with needed modifications
